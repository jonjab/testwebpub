When using markdown, your plain typing is regular paragraph style.
No spaces after line breaks will render continuous. That's so that you
can make your code nice and readable.

Sometimes you want to add **a little emphasis** or *some flair*

### two spaces
When typing tightly
and you want to put in
an rendered carriage return
/newline, you can end a line  
with two  
spaces  

Who says two spaces don't count anymore?
